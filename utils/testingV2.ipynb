In the past, derivative action was also\\nreferred to asrate action, pre-act,o r anticipatory con-\\ntrol. For example, suppose that a reactor temperature\\nincreases by 10∘C in a short period of time, say, 3 min.\\nThisclearlyisamorerapidincreaseintemperaturethan\\na1 0∘C rise in 30 min, and it could indicate a potential\\nrunaway situation for an exothermic reaction. If the\\nreactor were under manual control, an experienced\\nplant operator would anticipate the consequences and\\nquickly take appropriate corrective action to reduce\\nthe temperature. Such a response would not be obtain-\\nable from the proportional and integral control modes\\ndiscussed so far. Note that a proportional controller\\nreacts to a deviation in temperature only, making\\nno distinction as to the time period over which the\\ndeviation develops. Integral control action is also inef-', \"[SOURCE: Process Dynamics and Control| PAGE:140]\\n8.2 Basic Control Modes 129\\nof change of the error signal or the controlled variable.\\nThus, foridealderivative action,\\np(t)= p+τD\\nde(t)\\ndt (8-10)\\nwhere τD,t h ederivative time, has units of time. Note\\nthat the controller output is equal to the nominal value\\np as long as the error is constant (that is, as long as\\nde(t)/dt=0). Consequently, derivative action is never\\nusedalone;itisalwaysusedinconjunctionwithpropor-\\ntional or proportional-integral control. For example, an\\nideal PD controller has the transfer function:\\nP\\n′(s)\\nE(s) =Kc(1+τD s) (8-11)\\nBy providing anticipatory control action, the derivative\\nmode tends to stabilize the controlled process. Thus, it\\nis often used to counteract the destabilizing tendency of\\nthe integral mode (see Chapters 11 and 14).\\nDerivative control action also tends to improve the\\ndynamicresponseofthecontrolledvariablebyreducing\\nthe settling time, the time it takes to reach steady state.\\nBut if the process measurement isnoisy, that is, if it\\ncontains high-frequency, random fluctuations, then the\\nderivative of the measured variable will change wildly,\\nand derivative action will amplify the noise unless the\\nmeasurement is filtered, as discussed in Chapter 17.\\nConsequently, derivative action is seldom used for flow\\ncontrol, because flow control loops respond quickly and\\nflow measurements tend to be noisy.\\nUnfortunately, the ideal proportional-derivative con-\\ntrol algorithm in Eq. 8-11 is physically unrealizable\\nbecause it cannot be implemented exactly using either\\nanalog or digital controllers. For analog controllers, the\\ntransfer function in Eq. 8-11 can be approximated in\\nseveral ways. For example, by\\nP\\n′(s)\\nE(s) =Kc\\n(\\n1+ τD s\\nατD s+1\\n)\\n(8-12)\\nwhere the constantαtypically has a value between 0.05\\nand 0.2, with 0.1 being a common choice.

In general, the\\nvalues ofβ and γ are in the interval, [0, 1]. Often,γ is\\nselected to be zero.\\nThe modified PID control algorithm reduces to\\nthe standard algorithm in Eq. 8-13 when β=γ= 1.\\nSettingγ= 0 eliminates derivative kick. After a step\\nchange in set point, the standard algorithm results in a\\nproportionalkick, a sudden change in controller output\\np due to the sudden increase ine which results in a\\ncorresponding change in the proportional term. The\\namount of proportional kick after a sudden set-point\\nchange can be reduced by settingβ< 1.\\nThe β weighting parameter can be used to tune this\\nPID controller performance for set-point changes, as\\ndiscussed in Chapter 12. Note that the definition of\\nthe integral mode error in Eq. 8-20 is the same as for\\nthe standard control law in Eq. 8-13; this error term is\\nessential in order to eliminate offset after a set-point\\nchange or sustained disturbance.\\nFinally, it should be noted that, although digital\\ncontroller settings can be specified exactly, analog con-\\ntrollersettings represent only nominal values. Although\\nit would be desirable to be able to specifyK\\nc, τI, and\\nτD accurately and independently for analog controllers,\\nin practice there are interactions among the control\\nmodes owing to hardware limitations.

In the following derivations, we generally\\nassumethatthecontrollerisreverse-acting( K\\nc > 0).Ifa\\ncontrollerisdirect-acting( Kc < 0),the ARplotdoesnot\\nchange, because |Kc| is used in calculating the magni-\\ntude.However,thephaseangleisshiftedby −180∘when\\nKc isnegative.Forexample,adirect-actingproportional\\ncontroller (Kc < 0) has a constant phase angle of−180∘.\\nAs a practical matter, it is possible to use the\\nabsolute value of Kc to calculate ϕ when designing\\nclosed-loop control systems, because stability consider-\\nations (see Chapter 11) require thatK\\nc < 0 only when\\nKvKpKm < 0.Thischoiceguaranteesthattheopen-loop\\ngain (KOL =KcKvKpKm) will always be positive. Use\\nof this convention conveniently yieldsϕ= 0∘ for any\\nproportional controller and, in general, eliminates the\\nneed to consider the−180∘ phase shift contribution of\\nthe negative controller gain.\\nProportional Controller.Consider a proportional con-\\ntroller with positive gain\\nG\\nc(s)= Kc (14-34)\\nIn this case, |Gc(jω)|=Kc, which is independent ofω.\\nTherefore,\\nAR=Kc (14-35)\\nand\\nϕ= 0∘ (14-36)\\nProportional-Integral Controller.

The ideal\\nproportional-derivative (PD) controller (cf.
